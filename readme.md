# Code of Conduct

The Coder Coder Community is a place to support students learning web development. I'd like it to be an inclusive, welcoming online place. By participating in this community, you agree to abide by the conduct guidelines detailed below. Please note that behavior outside these guidelines may result in a warning or even being removed from the community.

## Spam

Sharing links to helpful coding resources is allowed, but please do not repeatedly post links or engage in excessive self-promotion. No affiliate or referral links are allowed.

## Harrassment

The Coder Coder Community is dedicated to providing an inclusive, welcoming, harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, age, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form, even if you think you are "just joking."

Harrassment includes:

1. Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, age, race, or religion.
2. Unwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, and employment.
3. Deliberate misgendering or use of ‘dead’ or rejected names.
4. Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behaviour in spaces where they’re not appropriate.
5. Physical contact and simulated physical contact (eg, textual descriptions like “_hug_” or “_backrub_”) without consent or after a request to stop.
6. Threats of violence.
7. Incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm.
8. Deliberate intimidation.
9. Stalking or following.
10. Harassing photography or recording, including logging online activity for harassment purposes.
11. Sustained disruption of discussion.
12. Unwelcome sexual attention.
13. Pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others
14. Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease.
15. Deliberate “outing” of any aspect of a person’s identity without their consent except as necessary to protect vulnerable people from intentional abuse.
16. Publication of non-harassing private communication.

In this community, we will prioritize marginalized people’s safety over privileged people’s comfort, and reserve the right not to act on complaints regarding:

- ‘Reverse’ -isms, including ‘reverse racism,’ ‘reverse sexism,’ and ‘cisphobia’
- Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as “leave me alone,” “go away,” or “I’m not discussing this with you.”
- Communicating in a ‘tone’ you don’t find congenial
- Criticizing racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behavior or assumptions

If you have witnessed someone violating the Code of Conduct, you can ping the @Moderator role (public) or privately DM @thecodercoder to report it.

## Enforcement

Participants asked to stop any behavior outside of the guidelines in the Code of Conduct are expected to comply immediately. They may also be given a warning, a time-out, kicked, or banned from the Coder Coder Community-- this is entirely at my sole discretion. If removed from the Community, they will still have access to the course materials, but will not be allowed back into the Community.

Reports intended to silence legitimate criticism may be deleted without response.

I will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse. At my discretion, I may publicly name a person about whom I've received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them, if I believe that doing so will increase the safety of the Community or the general public. I will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.

I reserve the right to remove any offending messages, images, etc.
